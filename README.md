# factory-optimization
This is a scolar project made on Matlab, the main software we use in my school for coding. The goal is to optimize the production of a factory according to the client's requests These requests must be met within the deadlines, and delivering outisde of these deadlines leads to penalties. The result is a plan of production of each factory each day.
