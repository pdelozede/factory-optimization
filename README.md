# factory-optimization
This is a scolar project made on Matlab, the main software we use in my school for coding. The goal is to optimize the production of factories according to the client's requests. These requests must be met within the deadlines.These deadlines are actually intervals, and delivering before or after these dates leads to penalties.
Each factory creates one type of product, and each clients wants different products within one delivery.
Moreover, the model accounts for several operational constraints and cost factors:
-maximum daily capacity
-stocking costs
-maximum flow capacity
-transportation costs

The result is a daily production, storage, and delivery schedule that satisfies all demands at minimum total cost.
